# Traffy Fondue Data Analysis

This is the project for the course **'Data Analysis with Python: Zero to Pandas'**. 

In this project, we analysed the data from an online platform called **'Traffy Fondue'** (ทราฟฟี่ฟองดูว์ / ท่านพี่ฟ้องดู), which was developed by the National Electronics and Computer Technology Center (NECTEC) of Thailand. This platform allows residents in Thailand to report (and follow) issues such as dangerous pedestrian paths, corruption, broken public electrical appliances, etc in real time. For more information, please refer to https://www.traffy.in.th/.
